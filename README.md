# Loan Analysis Project
 
This project analyzed small loan data to determine ML methods to identify likely defaults taking into account that the company cost to defaults is much greater than the missed opportunity of a successfully completed loan.

This project includes both a solution in R (r script), plus a solution in Python implemented in 3 jupyter notebooks (Loans_Analysis_EDA, Loans_Analysis_Prep, and Loan_Analysis_Modeling.
